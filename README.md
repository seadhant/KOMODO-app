Briefly About the Project:-
Our Project is based on an App that is designed by us to focus on responsible handling of E-waste.
INTRODUCTION- In India, the quantity of “e-waste” or electronic waste has now become a major problem. Disposal of e-waste is an emerging global environmental and public health issue, as this waste has become the most rapidly growing segment of the formal municipal waste stream in the world.

OUR PROJECT- We are developing an integrated network which will deal with proper disposal/implementation of used electronics gadgets of consumer and manufacturer. Our moto is to design an app which will facilitate the consumer to place their inoperative electronic gadgets in e -waste bin. The homepage of the app will consist of list of home appliances divided into three categories three major categories:

Electronics gadgets
TV& large appliances
Others.
HOW OUR APP WORKS-

The Electronics gadgets segment will enable the person to place products such as laptops, mobile Accessories, Televisions, cameras & Accessories, Tablets, Power banks, smartwatches etc. The TV& large Appliance section will allow the users to drop big commodities like Television, Toaster, Air conditioner etc. The Other section will include rest of the smaller electronic items.
The Consumer needs to select the category of product he/she wants to drop ,select the item and mention the model name. They need to upload a clicked picture of their item on the app so that it would be easier to access and verify the item. The mandatory details of the person would be asked such as address, contact no., email id.
We will circulate E- waste recycle bags in nearby electronics shops which will be available to the consumer, these will contain a blank label on it. They need to place the defective item in the bag and write the code generated in the app over the label on the bag and deposit in the E-Bins.
The big appliances will be picked up by the pick up truck from the home address and small electronic appliance should be disposed by the consumer in E -waste bin situated in every locality which will collected weekly.
The collected items will be properly examined by our reviewers (i.e. electronic retailers who have registered in our app as examiner) and will be forwarded in a large scale to big recycling companies such as Namo E-Waste .
Reward Offers:- Reviewers (i.e. electronic retailers who have registered in our app as examiner) will disintegrate the model and analyse the functioning of each part. In case the item is no more in condition for repairment, then the valuable elements can be extracted such as golds, aluminium, silver from PCVs, and be supplied it companies. On the basis of reviewer’s reports on each item we will reward points and gifts to the user. These rewards can be used to buy products on weekly sale inside our app economy environment.
